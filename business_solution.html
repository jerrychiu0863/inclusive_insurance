                <section>
                    <p>Group health insurance coverage is a policy that is purchased by an employer and is offered to eligible employees of the company (and often to the employees’ family members) as a benefit of working for that company. A group health insurance plan is a key component of many employee benefits packages that employers provide for employees. <br><br>The majority of Americans have group health insurance coverage through their employer or the employer of a family member. One of the advantages for employees in a group health plan is the contribution most employers make toward the cost of the health coverage premium – in many cases, employers pay one-half or more of the monthly premium for an employee. Another advantage is that most employers have established Premium Only Plans (often called POP plans) that allow employees to pay any employee-required contributions to premiums on a pre-tax basis. Between the employer contributions, which aren’t taxable for employees, and the POP plan, employer-provided health insurance is significantly subsidized due to these tax breaks.</p>

                    <p>Have you ever thought about your physical location and all that it means to you?  What would happen if it were suddenly gone?</p>
                    <p>Here is a true story that is all too common:</p>
                    <p>A business owner had achieved his dream:  A profitable business, a nice location and after years of planning and holding steadfast to his goals he had reached comfortable success.  He had developed good traffic into his store front which was attached to offices which flowed out into a rather large warehouse.  The warehouse held his inventory for the store and online sales.  Being a reasonable person he had insured his building for what he felt was an adequate amount.</p>
                    <p>Then disaster struck.  During a storm the roof on his warehouse collapsed.  His building was a complete loss.  So was his inventory. His store front had to be closed.  His online sales ground to a halt.  While the building was covered by insurance he had failed to adequately protect his “business”.  He lost more than his building.  He lost his inventory, his livelihood and his employees were suddenly out on the street.</p>
                    <p>As important as it is the physical presence of your business is more than a building, office or store front.  It is the public expression of your inner vision.  It is your livelihood and your future.  Property is more than just property when you are in business, and insurance should cover more than just a roof collapse or a fire.  That’s why we work with you to take into consideration the unique aspects of your entire business and all of the possible catastrophes that might have exposure.  And yes…we can still keep your premiums manageable.</p>

                <section>
                   <p>Many of us may have seen our retirement savings eroded recently, and retirement may feel that much farther away. When conditions are difficult, you want to find ways to save that feel secure – and offer upside potential. Bottom line, it is more important than ever to continue to save, or start if you have not.</p>
                   <h4>Saving early pays off</h4>
                   <p>If you start saving early, a small amount can make a big difference. Assume you start saving $3,000 per year at age 50, with an 8% return. At age 65 you’ll have nearly $100,000. If you start saving the same $3,000 amount (at the same 8% return) at age 35 instead of at age 50, you’ll have saved nearly $400,000 by age 65. That’s four times as much. It pays to start early.</p>
                   <p>Look at it this way:  Would you want your ultimate reward for taking the risk of being a business owner left up to chance, a person you may not have even met yet (such as a buyer) or delayed?  The real fact that all small business owners must remember remains universal:  Do something…don’t wait.</p>

                <section>
                   <p>Every business is different and calls for special considerations.  But some are more “special” than others and call for unusual protection.  Knowing what to look for in a business policy, however, and finding those unique coverages –  or even being aware of what is needed – can be problematic.</p>
                   <p>Special risk industries should not rely on standard business policies offered by every agent on the corner.  This is one area of insurance where “one size fits all” does not work.  The restaurant/bar, for example, has totally different needs from the average retailer.  The government sub-contractor will be required to carry coverages the construction company may not have to have.  Seemingly benign non-profits doing great public works are subject to unusual liability hazards and need a unique set of insurance coverages.</p>
                   <p>You get our point:  In the specialty risk world all are different, all have particular exposures, and all need highly specific coverage considerations your family or neighborhood agent may not have access to.</p>
                   <p>This is an area of coverage that escapes the due diligence of most agencies.  Yes, they say they can place your needed coverages but they then scramble to understand special needs, policies and fulfill their promises…much like a general practitioner who says he or she can do a heart transplant.  The results, just when you need them the most, may be less than you expected.</p>
                   <p>Inclusive Insurance, on the other hand, excels in experience in special risk industries.  We are the specialist; we place special risk policies for every business imaginable on a routine basis.  Our experience means you won’t have gaps in coverage.  We know the right questions to ask and the possible exposures to be aware of.  The high number of special risk carriers we do business with on a regular basis means we can sit down and present you to the insurance companies…making sure you get the right coverage at the right rate with the right carrier for your needs.</p>
                   <p>Specialty risks are part of our job, but they aren’t all part of every agent’s job.  Make sure you work with a specialist…like Inclusive Insurance.</p>
                   <p>Who is at risk:</p>
                   <ul>

                   <p>We’re not going to pretend that there is a magic bullet for immediately helping you reduce costs for worker’s compensation coverage.  Avoid any agent that tells you otherwise.  Aside from shopping your coverage with the numerous carriers we represent for favorable rates, in the short term rates are what they are and if you take this approach you will end up “rate chasing” every year.</p>
                   <p>But there are things you can do in the long run, things we will help you implement, which can work toward better experience and lower modifying factors that have a deep impact on what you will pay for years to come.</p>
                   <p>To be in the best position for worker’s compensation coverage requires ongoing management.  This is more than rate shopping.  It is things like good communication between you and your employees about safety, managing the transition back to work, treatment oversight and claims management.  These are all things we can help you implement to ensure systems are in place which cut worker’s compensation claims and, ultimately, coverage costs.  By doing so you’ll find that worker’s compensation coverage, over the long run, is one of the most manageable expenses of all insurance coverages.</p>
                   <p>Someone, somewhere in a land far away decided worker’s compensation would be required of all employers…and it is not totally a bad thing.  But that does not mean you cannot be proactive today in managing the cost.  Let us shop for our current best rate from the many carriers we represent, but then let us help you strategize and cut those future costs over the long term with smart management.  It’s what we do.  It’s what sets Inclusive Insurance’s services apart from our competition.</p>

                   <p>Making decisions in the corporate world is a tough act of courage, but in today’s climate of litigation, watchdog groups and stock holder activism it is even tougher. Corporate governance and fiduciary responsibility leaves little room for missteps even with the best of intentions in mind. The daily decisions made by corporate officers and directors can leave any company financially at risk, and that can trickle down to individual assets.</p>
                   <p>The team at Inclusive Insurance understands the necessity in taking risks, but we also understand the financial repercussions those risks can inadvertently cause. We bring both experience and carriers to your table to provide you with comprehensive protection, and we help you manage those risks through thorough understanding and the right liability protection for all possible scenarios:</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li>Employment and Discrimination Liability</li>

                   <p>Through our insurance carriers and their legal teams we remain up to date on changes in case law as they develop.We’ll assess your risks and potential liabilities to balance those risks with appropriate rewards of coverages such as E&amp;O, Employment Liability and the never changing field of Cyber Space.</p>
                   <p>Let us do a fact finding assessment of your current status to begin protecting your executives and board members with appropriate coverages and liability management planning.</p>

                   <p>The employee benefit landscape is getting very complex. A company cannot look at benefits without a holistic view of the landscape and strategic planning. To not do so only invites challenges to HR and finance departments, and now the impending audits promised by the IRS under Obamacare.</p>
                   <p>When it comes to employee benefits our mantra is our practice: Knowledgeable consultation regarding the challenges coming from both within and from outside the enterprise. One will affect the other, just as a singular focus on one form of benefits will impact another.</p>
                   <p>Inclusive Insurance employee benefit experts will focus on building that holistic view and strategic plan. From fully insured to fully self-funded plans we will make sure your company stays within today’s compliance necessities. We’ll also consult with you on your retirement benefits and then build strategies that provide cost and tax advantaged roadmaps for effective management. We’ll even work with employees and union leaders when necessary to communicate the reasons for change, emphasizing the external forces at work that you have no control over.</p>
                   <p>This holistic view keeps your employee benefit plans cost effective and compliant. Within today’s complex benefit landscape you cannot do better than Inclusive Insurance.</p>

                   <p>Productivity is of utmost importance for any enterprise, and Loss Control Services may be one of the most advantageous sources to accomplish the end result. Not only do Loss Control Services help to contain insurance costs, it helps the company put a plan into place for determining possible risk and minimizing or eliminating the eventual cost.</p>
                   <p>We work with organizations to avoid and/or control the cost of accidents and injuries which in turn cuts and the lost productivity that occurs during those times. We do this by coordinating and establishing a bridge of communication between carriers and you. A written service plan is developed, along with a method of monitoring and measuring the effectiveness of the service. This in turn becomes a cooperative agreement between you and your carrier which, through proven experience, cuts the premium cost and lost productivity.</p>
                   <p>Talk to us about developing an individually tailored plan to meet your exact situation, and begin taking advantage of reduced premiums and higher productivity.</p>

                <section>
                   <p>Highly compensated employees often have a high net worth, but with those benefits comes a high exposure to personal loss, property loss and liability. Distinctive homes, second homes, watercraft, personal collections and fine art are just a few examples of collective worth than may need special protection. In addition, many underestimate the ongoing value of incomes, inheritances and estates when it comes to asset/income protection and tax ramifications.</p>
                   <p>Fortunately our experience with persons of high net worth allows us to know what questions to ask and what exposures may need coverage. We also look to the future and work with estate attorneys and CPAs to provide comprehensive planning for retirement and wealth transfer strategies. The result is a portfolio encompassing all of your highly compensated employees concerns for:</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li>Asset Protection</li>

                   <p>Inclusive Insurance’s Private Client Service Packages is so complete and cost effective that many companies make it a part of their executives “no cost” benefit package.</p>

                <section>
                   <p>In most small businesses the owner is the key person.  In many there may be more than one owner; in some there may be a key individual pivotal to the business’ success, such as a lead sales person.  So what would happen if something happened to one of those key people?</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li>What would it take to maintain the business while the heirs found a suitable buyer?</li>
                    <li>How would the surviving partner(s) buy out the heirs?</li>
                    <li>And what about the owner?</li>
                    <li>Can a plan be structured to provide retirement income and protect the future of a business?</li>
                    <li>Would the business be able to continue if something happened to the owner?</li>
                    <li>In the case of multiple owners, does a surviving partner really want to be in business with a deceased partner’s heirs?</li>
                    <li>Is there a way to provide golden handcuffs for that key person so the competition can’t steal him or her away?</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>What we are describing here is called “key person coverage”.  It is for those key people who are crucial to the continuation of any business whether they be sole owners, partners or key individuals within their employ.  It can be used for continuing a business and providing an income should something happen to the key person, and/or it can provide retirement rewards in the future.</p>
                   <p>A business has a life and legacy of its own.  Making sure it can survive and those left behind are taken care of financially is even more critical for the small business than for the large corporation because the roles each key person plays are so vital, extensive and financially far-reaching.</p>
