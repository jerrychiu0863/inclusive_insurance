                <section>
                    <p>Group health insurance coverage is a policy that is purchased by an employer and is offered to eligible employees of the company (and often to the employees’ family members) as a benefit of working for that company. A group health insurance plan is a key component of many employee benefits packages that employers provide for employees. <br><br>The majority of Americans have group health insurance coverage through their employer or the employer of a family member. One of the advantages for employees in a group health plan is the contribution most employers make toward the cost of the health coverage premium – in many cases, employers pay one-half or more of the monthly premium for an employee. Another advantage is that most employers have established Premium Only Plans (often called POP plans) that allow employees to pay any employee-required contributions to premiums on a pre-tax basis. Between the employer contributions, which aren’t taxable for employees, and the POP plan, employer-provided health insurance is significantly subsidized due to these tax breaks.</p>

                    <p>Have you ever thought about your physical location and all that it means to you?  What would happen if it were suddenly gone?</p>
                    <p>Here is a true story that is all too common:</p>
                    <p>A business owner had achieved his dream:  A profitable business, a nice location and after years of planning and holding steadfast to his goals he had reached comfortable success.  He had developed good traffic into his store front which was attached to offices which flowed out into a rather large warehouse.  The warehouse held his inventory for the store and online sales.  Being a reasonable person he had insured his building for what he felt was an adequate amount.</p>
                    <p>Then disaster struck.  During a storm the roof on his warehouse collapsed.  His building was a complete loss.  So was his inventory. His store front had to be closed.  His online sales ground to a halt.  While the building was covered by insurance he had failed to adequately protect his “business”.  He lost more than his building.  He lost his inventory, his livelihood and his employees were suddenly out on the street.</p>
                    <p>As important as it is the physical presence of your business is more than a building, office or store front.  It is the public expression of your inner vision.  It is your livelihood and your future.  Property is more than just property when you are in business, and insurance should cover more than just a roof collapse or a fire.  That’s why we work with you to take into consideration the unique aspects of your entire business and all of the possible catastrophes that might have exposure.  And yes…we can still keep your premiums manageable.</p>

                <section>
                   <p>Many of us may have seen our retirement savings eroded recently, and retirement may feel that much farther away. When conditions are difficult, you want to find ways to save that feel secure – and offer upside potential. Bottom line, it is more important than ever to continue to save, or start if you have not.</p>
                   <h4>Saving early pays off</h4>
                   <p>If you start saving early, a small amount can make a big difference. Assume you start saving $3,000 per year at age 50, with an 8% return. At age 65 you’ll have nearly $100,000. If you start saving the same $3,000 amount (at the same 8% return) at age 35 instead of at age 50, you’ll have saved nearly $400,000 by age 65. That’s four times as much. It pays to start early.</p>
                   <p>Look at it this way:  Would you want your ultimate reward for taking the risk of being a business owner left up to chance, a person you may not have even met yet (such as a buyer) or delayed?  The real fact that all small business owners must remember remains universal:  Do something…don’t wait.</p>

                <section>
                   <p>Every business is different and calls for special considerations.  But some are more “special” than others and call for unusual protection.  Knowing what to look for in a business policy, however, and finding those unique coverages –  or even being aware of what is needed – can be problematic.</p>
                   <p>Special risk industries should not rely on standard business policies offered by every agent on the corner.  This is one area of insurance where “one size fits all” does not work.  The restaurant/bar, for example, has totally different needs from the average retailer.  The government sub-contractor will be required to carry coverages the construction company may not have to have.  Seemingly benign non-profits doing great public works are subject to unusual liability hazards and need a unique set of insurance coverages.</p>
                   <p>You get our point:  In the specialty risk world all are different, all have particular exposures, and all need highly specific coverage considerations your family or neighborhood agent may not have access to.</p>
                   <p>This is an area of coverage that escapes the due diligence of most agencies.  Yes, they say they can place your needed coverages but they then scramble to understand special needs, policies and fulfill their promises…much like a general practitioner who says he or she can do a heart transplant.  The results, just when you need them the most, may be less than you expected.</p>
                   <p>Inclusive Insurance, on the other hand, excels in experience in special risk industries.  We are the specialist; we place special risk policies for every business imaginable on a routine basis.  Our experience means you won’t have gaps in coverage.  We know the right questions to ask and the possible exposures to be aware of.  The high number of special risk carriers we do business with on a regular basis means we can sit down and present you to the insurance companies…making sure you get the right coverage at the right rate with the right carrier for your needs.</p>
                   <p>Specialty risks are part of our job, but they aren’t all part of every agent’s job.  Make sure you work with a specialist…like Inclusive Insurance.</p>

                   <p>In today’s lawsuit-happy society, wise people choose to protect their assets and their bank accounts from litigious judgments they may receive against them.</p>
                   <p>When your other insurance has reached its limit of protection, such as car or homeowners coverage, Umbrella policies will broaden your financial protection by paying claims up to the amounts covered. It is an inexpensive way to provide broader coverage against litigation and judgments which unfortunately are all too common in today’s world. Umbrella policies will even protect you for something more obscure, like slander, libel or false arrest.</p>
                   <p>Umbrella Insurance should be as much a part of your insurance portfolio as home, car and health insurance. It is usually the least costly of all insurances but the benefits, potential payout and peace of mind are enormous.</p>
